# Bits

A fast bit set (aka bit array) implementation in Javascript by using an array 
of integers to store the state. Besides _set_ and _test_ primitives it allows to 
perform bitwise operations between bitsets.

The memory consumption should be just above the double of the number of bits stored
in the set, since JS casts to 32bit integers before doing bitwise operations even
if the internal numeric type is always 64bit long.

It should be compatible with most Javascript environments be it in the browser
or in the server.


## Example

    // Create a new bit set
    var bs = new Bits();

    bs.set(100);
    if (bs.test(100)) {
        alert('Bit 100 was set!');
    }

    // Clone the bit set
    var bs2 = bs.clone();

    // Apply XOR on the first set against the values in the second
    bs.xor(bs2);
    if (bs.test(100)) {
        alert('Bit 100 is still set but it should not!');
    }


## Using in Node

    // Import the library with require
    var Bits = require('./path/to/Bits.js').Bits;


## More information

The library is dead simple, just check out the source code to find out more ;)
